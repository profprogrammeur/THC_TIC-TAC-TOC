# THP_TIC-TAC-TOC

## Purpose
* The game is only played by two human players (we don't ask you to code artificial intelligence today...); 
* The program must start by asking the first name of each player; The game board is composed of 9 squares, each designated by its vertical position (A, B or C) followed by its horizontal position (1, 2 or 3). 
* Examples: the top right square is called "A3" and the bottom right square is called "C3"; At the beginning of each round, the program displays the game board in the terminal. 
* Then it asks the player whose turn it is to play; The players take turns playing until one of them wins or the board is full; The program must detect the end of the game. If a player wins, the game announces his name. 
* If there is a draw, the program must inform both players; At the end of a game, the program must offer to start a new game; An effort should be made on the display of the game in the terminal (e.g.: board displayed in a stylish way, game counter, colors, etc.)
